# Steps to Create a Smart Contract for IPFS Data Management

Creating a smart contract to manage data stored on IPFS involves integrating the IPFS hash (which uniquely identifies the data) with the blockchain system. Here's a step-by-step guide, describing how to manage IPFS-stored data using Ethereum and Solidity.

- Store Data on IPFS:

  1. Before interacting with the blockchain, you must first upload your data to IPFS. This can be done via tools like the IPFS command line interface, IPFS HTTP API, or IPFS gateways.
  2. Once uploaded, IPFS will return a hash (a unique identifier for your file).
